The first season of ARTISTRY, started by Whitemarker with the aim of imparting the knowledge of experienced personalities in the field of graphic designing to other designers, ended on a grand note. Beginning with renowned Illustrator Arosh Thevadathilâ€™s experience sharing class at the renowned Illustrator's Awards, Artistry honored him and felicitated Whitemarker's alumni for their outstanding achievements. At this time, Whitemarker would like to express its heartfelt thanks to Arosh who started the artistry and all the others who have contributed to this, and that Whitemarker's initiative of contributing the best designers to the field of graphic designing will continue by mobilizing eminent personalities in various fields of designing."
